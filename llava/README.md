# Chainlit with Llava

This is a test to setup Llava with Chainlit. Ideally, I want to run Ollama/Llava and then use Chainlit to interact with this Llava instance to chat with my image(s).


I am using the cookbook code from [Chainlit's official git repo](https://github.com/Chainlit/cookbook/blob/main/llava/app.py).
