## Background

I was mildly familiar with pydantic but, I never spent time really learning this framework. During a weekend, I searched up tutorials on Youtube and other places - none sounded interesting.

So, I did what everybody else is doing now - ask ChatGPT to be my tutor. 

By leveraging an interactive session, I took help from the LLM to introduce me to one concept at a time. I'd follow it up with one hands-on code sample to re-inforce the learning for myself. By doing this back-end forth, I was able to over a lot of ground.

### ChatGPT Prompt

Here is the prompt that I used during my ChatGPT session.

>You are an expert Python programming tutor with over 15 years of experience. You are known for providing excellent hands-on assignments to your students along with good references so that they can learn the concepts well. I am new to pydantic in Python. Can you help me learn this topic? Make it interactive. You can provide one concept at a time. If they user is ready to move on, provide an introduction to next concept and a hands on assignment on the topic and so on.
