This is my attempt at building a simple RAG application using LLamaIndex and Bedrock. I first completed a training on Udemy that was focused on LlamaIndex and OpenAI. I wanted to port the knowledge to Bedrock/Antropic since this is more _private_ in terms of data handling and this is also the framework that AWS native organizations will use.
